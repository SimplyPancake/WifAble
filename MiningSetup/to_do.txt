to do

+ Add tutorial to read me for these files.
+ make script that grabs all ip address of all connected users, adds it to a file.
+ make local http server connect to our host, add authentication.
+ set up SSL strip for non port 80 websites
+ maybe some user interaction with http server could make injecting easier?
