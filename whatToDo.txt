Business model:
We will make a github project that people can install on their unix systems. the
more people use their Wi-Fi connection, the more we can mine and the more we earn.
This means they can also get more money, when more people use their WiFi network.
This should encourage people to make their host the most accessible.

Slogan ideas:
1.  Make money by using your WiFI!
2.  Make money with your internet!
